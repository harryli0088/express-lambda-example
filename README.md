# express-lambda-example

I followed this tutorial to learn more about AWS Lambda and Serverless functions
https://www.sitepoint.com/a-guide-to-serverless-deployment-with-express-and-mongodb/

I also modified the HTML/CSS and added a deploy script with esbuild (https://www.npmjs.com/package/esbuild).

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. ```npm i``` to install the dependencies
3. ```npm start``` to start the app in development mode (assumes you have a local Mongo DB running)
